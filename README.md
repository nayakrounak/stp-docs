This GitBook serves as a central knowledge base for **deployment runbooks** and **project documentation** for multiple digital transformation initiatives delivered in **São Tomé & Príncipe (STP)** by **Ooru Digital Private Limited**.

It includes practical, implementation-oriented guidance such as:

* **Deployment documentation** (environment preparation, infrastructure setup, installation steps, validation gates)
* **Architecture and topology references** (logical building blocks, network zones, exposure policies)
* **Operations documentation** (monitoring, logging, backups, DR, runbooks, troubleshooting)
* **Integration documentation** (interfaces, security controls, data exchange patterns, reconciliation)
* **Project-specific notes and decisions** (assumptions, constraints, configuration baselines, change history)

Each project section is structured to support both **initial deployment** and **day-2 operations**, and is intended to be used by government technical stakeholders, system integrators, and operations/support teams.

> **Note:** Content is maintained and updated as implementations evolve, and should be treated as the authoritative reference for the documented deployments and operational procedures.
